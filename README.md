# Decentralized Advertising Platform

A blockchain-based advertising platform that brings transparency, fairness, and user privacy to digital advertising through smart contracts.

## Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) revolutionizes digital advertising by creating a direct connection between advertisers, publishers, and viewers. Smart contracts ensure transparent ad delivery, fair compensation, and verifiable metrics while protecting user privacy.

## Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contract components:

1. **Ad Contract:** Manages ad creation and targeting
    - Handles ad content storage and verification
    - Implements targeting parameters and rules
    - Manages ad budgets and bidding
    - Controls ad scheduling and frequency
    - Ensures content compliance and standards

2. **Publisher Contract:** Handles website registration and inventory
    - Manages publisher verification and reputation
    - Tracks available ad space inventory
    - Controls ad placement preferences
    - Handles revenue distribution
    - Implements quality control measures

3. **Viewer Contract:** Tracks engagement and rewards
    - Manages anonymous viewer profiles
    - Tracks ad viewing and interaction
    - Distributes viewer rewards
    - Handles privacy preferences
    - Prevents fraud and abuse

4. **Analytics Contract:** Provides performance metrics
    - Tracks impressions and engagement
    - Calculates conversion rates
    - Measures ROI and campaign performance
    - Generates transparent reporting
    - Ensures data integrity
